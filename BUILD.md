## Icons

### Download and Convert
```
apt install -y imagemagick

mkdir assets
curl -o assets/logo.jpg "https://media.istockphoto.com/id/157644325/photo/water-drop.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=O8khr7owdRAntRRK2R42a4TDGxBsb3J1_jNbSGyBmW8="
mogrify -format png assets/*.jpg
rm assets/logo.jpg
```

### Generate Icons
https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor-assets

1. generates icons in ./icons
1. creates manifest in ./public/manifest.webmanifest
- NOTE: path is wrong ../icons
- can update manifest generated by ionic --pwaManifestPath dist/manifest.webmanifest

```
npm install --save-dev @capacitor/assets
npx @capacitor/assets generate --iconBackgroundColor '#eeeeee' --iconBackgroundColorDark '#222222' --splashBackgroundColor '#eeeeee' --splashBackgroundColorDark '#111111' --pwaManifestPath dist/manifest.webmanifest
```

### Manually Fix Manifest
Merge Vite generated dist/manifest.webmanifest into file generated by capacitor-assets.

Move icons/ to public/icons/

Add manifest: false to vite.config.ts

### Icon Not Working
31/3 after improvements above the icon doesn't display anymore on home screen

S3 versioning was not enabled and manifest was manually edited in dist/ folder so not tracked in Git.

No changes to manifest appear to take affect.

Workaround: Add link to different file in index.html
